# Tech-Trends-Survey-EDA-with-Python

## Project Overview
This project delves into the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2023, conducted between May 8th and 19th.  Qualified respondents completed the survey in a median time of 17 minutes.  Stack Overflow primarily recruited participants through owned channels such as onsite messaging, blog posts, email lists, and social media.

The goal of this project is to explore the dataset and create visualizations and find insights that will answer the following guiding questions.

Are you more likely to get a job as a developer if you have a Master's degree?</br>
What are the job roles that pay the most for developers?</br>
How does coding experience affect the level of pay?</br>
What's the most popular method of learning to code?

## Conclusion 
### Demographics:

Geographic Distribution: A significant portion of respondents (majority from USA and India) came from regions where English is prominent. This suggests the survey may be representative of English-speaking programmers, but potentially underrepresents non-English speaking regions.</br>
Age: The 20-40 year old age group, with a concentration between 25-30, makes up the majority of respondents. This highlights a strong youth presence in the programming field.
Gender: The data reveals a significant gender gap, with only 8% of respondents identifying as women or non-binary. This suggests a need for increased inclusivity in the programming community.

### Education and Employment:

Formal Education: While a bachelor's or master's degree is held by roughly 50% of respondents, a notable 40% with college degrees have non-computer science backgrounds. This indicates that formal computer science education, while valuable, is not the sole path to a programming career.</br>
Employment Status: Full-time employment is the most common (over 70%), followed by self-employed/freelance work (around 10%).

### Programming Languages and Trends:

Popularity: JavaScript & HTML/CSS were the most popular languages in 2020, followed by SQL and Python.</br>
Language by Role: Students favored HTML/CSS, while professionals preferred JavaScript. Python dominated among data scientists, followed by SQL.</br>
Loved vs. Dreaded: Rust and TypeScript were the most well-liked languages in 2020, with VBA and Objective-C being the least preferred.</br>
Learning Preferences: Python was the most desired language for future learning.

### Work Culture and Habits:

Working Hours: The average workweek for programmers was around 41 hours, with North America having the highest reported hours.</br>
Age of Entry: Most respondents began programming before 40, indicating that anyone can learn to code at any age.

### Next Steps
Building on this analysis, a future project could explore constructing a logistic regression model. This model would aim to predict the likelihood of a respondent being a professional developer based solely on their highest level of formal education.

If the model performs well, we can delve deeper by analyzing its coefficients. These coefficients will reveal the relative impact of each education level on the odds of being a professional developer. This insight could be valuable for aspiring programmers weighing the role of formal education in their career path.
